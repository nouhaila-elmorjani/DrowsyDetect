# DrowsyDetect: Real-Time Drowsiness Detection

A real-time drowsiness detection system for CPAP therapy monitoring, driver fatigue detection, and medical vigilance assessment. Built with MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Streamlit.

## 🎯 Project Goal

DrowsyDetect provides real-time facial analysis to detect drowsiness and fatigue using computer vision. The system monitors eye and mouth movements via facial landmarks, enabling timely alerts for:

- **CPAP Therapy Monitoring** – Ensure patient vigilance during treatment sessions
- **Driver Safety** – Detect driver fatigue to prevent accidents
- **Medical Assessment** – Track alertness metrics for clinical research

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-Time Drowsiness Detection** – Processes video frames at 30+ FPS using facial landmarks
- **Modern MediaPipe Tasks API** – Uses the latest face detection model with automatic download
- **Live Web Dashboard** – Streamlit-based UI for real-time monitoring and session history
- **Audio/Visual Alerts** – Immediate notifications when drowsiness is detected
- **Cross-Platform** – Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## 🔬 How It Works

The system uses **facial landmark detection** to compute two key metrics:

### Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- Computes the ratio of vertical to horizontal eye dimensions
- EAR < 0.25 indicates closed eyes (potential drowsiness)
- Alert triggered after 20 consecutive frames of closed eyes

### Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)
- Detects mouth opening (yawning/fatigue indicator)
- MAR > 0.5 indicates open mouth
- Alert triggered after 35 consecutive frames of open mouth

The system uses MediaPipe's 468-point facial landmark model to extract precise eye and mouth coordinates, then applies SciPy distance calculations to determine the aspect ratios.

## 📋 System Requirements

- **Python:** 3.8 or later (tested on 3.13)
- **Camera:** Webcam or USB camera
- **Disk Space:** ~100 MB (including model file)
- **RAM:** Minimum 2 GB

### Supported Platforms
- macOS (10.14+)
- Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
- Windows 10/11

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DrowsyDetect.git
cd DrowsyDetect

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### Usage

**Real-Time Detection (Terminal)**
\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`
- Press \`q\` to quit
- Camera window shows live feed with facial landmarks
- Alerts appear in red text when drowsiness is detected
- Audio alert plays when drowsiness threshold is exceeded

**Live Dashboard (Web)**
\`\`\`bash
streamlit run dashboard_live.py
\`\`\`
- Open browser to \`http://localhost:8501\`
- Click "Start Monitoring" to begin
- View real-time video feed with overlay
- See detection history and session statistics

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit \`config.py\` to customize detection parameters:

\`\`\`python
# Eye closure threshold (0-1 scale)
EYE_AR_THRESH = 0.25

# Mouth opening threshold (0-1 scale)
MOUTH_AR_THRESH = 0.5

# Frames to trigger eye closure alert
EYE_FRAMES_THRESHOLD = 20

# Frames to trigger mouth opening alert
MOUTH_FRAMES_THRESHOLD = 35

# Camera selection (0=default webcam, 1=external USB, etc.)
CAMERA_INDEX = 0
\`\`\`

## 🔄 Key Algorithms

### Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) Formula
\`\`\`
EAR = (||p2 - p6|| + ||p3 - p5||) / (2 × ||p1 - p4||)
where p1-p6 are the 6 eye landmark coordinates
\`\`\`

### Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) Formula
\`\`\`
MAR = (||p2 - p10|| + ||p4 - p8||) / (2 × ||p0 - p6||)
where p0-p10 are the 12 mouth landmark coordinates
\`\`\`

Both use **Euclidean distance** via SciPy's \`scipy.spatial.distance.euclidean()\`.

## 📦 Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| mediapipe | ≥0.10.30 | Face landmark detection |
| opencv-python | ≥4.8.1 | Video capture and rendering |
| streamlit | ≥1.28.0 | Web dashboard |
| numpy | ≥1.26.0 | Array operations |
| scipy | ≥1.11.0 | Distance calculations |
| pygame | ≥2.5.0 | Audio playback |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'mediapipe'"
\`\`\`bash
pip install mediapipe>=0.10.30
\`\`\`

### Camera not opening
- Try \`CAMERA_INDEX = 1\` in config.py
- Check camera permissions (macOS/Linux)
- Verify no other app is using the camera

### "No face detected"
- Ensure face is well-lit and centered in frame
- Reduce distance to camera (6 inches - 2 feet optimal)
- Check camera lens is clean

### Model download failed
The model auto-downloads on first run. If it fails:
\`\`\`bash
# Manual download
mkdir -p models
curl -L -o models/face_landmarker.task \\
  https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/vision/face_landmarker/float16/1/face_landmarker.task
\`\`\`

## 🔐 Privacy & Data
- All processing happens **locally** – no cloud uploads
- No data collection or storage
- Camera feed never leaves your device
- Suitable for medical/clinical environments

## 🎓 Use Cases
- **Clinical Settings**: Monitor patient alertness during CPAP therapy
- **Transportation**: Driver fatigue detection systems
- **Academic Research**: Sleep science studies and attention span measurement
